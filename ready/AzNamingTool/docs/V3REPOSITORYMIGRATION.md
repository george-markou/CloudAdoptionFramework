## Azure Naming Tool v3.0.0 Repository Migration Instructions
<br />

# * * * IMPORTANT! * * *
### Overview
With the release of v3.0.0, the Azure Naming Tool will be moving to a new GitHub repository. This change will allow for easier code/project management, more frequent updates, and increased feedback and reporting capabilities. This article details the migration process for the new repository.
<br /><br /><br />   
## Instructions
### 1. [Backup](/ready/AzNamingTool/docs/UPDATING.md#backup-settings) your current Azure Naming Tool installation
### 2. Backup code modifications/customizations
### 3. Review the [Installation](/ready/AzNamingTool/docs/INSTALLATION.md) process for your environment
<br /><br /><br />
## The Details
### Why are we doing this?
Since its release, the Azure Naming Tool has been a part of the Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF) repository, along with several other tools and documentation. As the CAF repository has grown, this has complicated the installation and maintenance of the Azure Naming Tool and its development. To simplify this process and enhance user experience, we will be migrating the Azure Naming Tool to a separate GitHub repository in the next release (v3.0.0). The result of this migration will be a streamlined Azure Naming Tool installation experience, enhanced feedback capabilities, and more frequent updates to the tool.

### Preparing for the migration
While every effort has been made to minimize the impact, the migration of the Azure Naming Tool will require action from the users. This will include backing up their current configuration, forking/cloning a new repository, migrating any code changes, and re-deploying their environment. To prepare for this migration, users should complete the following: 

#### 1. Backup your current Azure Naming Tool installation.

It is recommended you create a [**Backup**](/ready/AzNamingTool/docs/UPDATING.md#backup-settings) of your configuration prior to the migration. This will ensure your customizations are retained and applied to the new installation. 

#### 2. Backup code modifications/customizations

The v3.0.0 migration process will require a completely new installation of the tool for your [**Installation**](/ready/AzNamingTool/docs/INSTALLATION.md) method. Depending on your selection, this may include:

- New GitHub repository (new fork of the Azure Naming Tool repo)
- New GitHub secrets (if using the GitHub Action)

To prepare for these changes, it is recommended that create a backup of any customizations you have made to codebase for the tool (if any). These changes will need to manually migrated to the new repository once it is released. 

#### 3. Review your installation process

The migration to the new GitHub repository will require users to deploy a new installation of the code. It is recommended that users review the [**Installation**](/ready/AzNamingTool/docs/INSTALLATION.md) process for their desired environment prior to the migration.

## Migration Timeline
The following section details the migration timeline for the v3.0.0 release.

1. v2.8.0 is released
    - Users will be informed of the upcoming code migration.
    - Users will be informed of the need to [**Backup**](/ready/AzNamingTool/docs/UPDATING.md#backup-settings) their configuration.
2. v3.0.0 is released
    - All code is migrated to the new Azure Naming Tool GitHub repository.
    - All code within the current [**CloudAdoptionFramework/ready/AzNamingTool**](https://github.com/microsoft/CloudAdoptionFramework/tree/master/ready/AzNamingTool) is removed. Navigation links will be updated to point to the new repository.
    - Users will be required to fork the new repository and update their [**Installation**](/ready/AzNamingTool/docs/INSTALLATION.md) method (if applicable).
    - Users will be required to manually migrate any customizations they have made to the codebase.
    - Users will be required to re-deploy the application using the new GitHub repository and their selected [**Installation**](/ready/AzNamingTool/docs/INSTALLATION.md) method.
        - If using the built in GitHub Action, users will be required to create new GitHub secrets for the new repository.
    - Users will be required to [**Restore**](/ready/AzNamingTool/docs/UPDATING.md#restore-settings) their configuration backup (if applicable).
